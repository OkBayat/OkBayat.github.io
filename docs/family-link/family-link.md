# FamilyLink

FamilyLink is committed to reducing the number of [orphans](../conversational-domain/orphan) in orphanages by providing support to single mothers, grandparents caring for their children or grandchildren, and other guardians. We assist them through resources such as financial aid, counseling, and legal support, helping them create a stable and nurturing environment for their children. **Our goal is to strengthen families to maintain cohesion and prevent unnecessary separations of children from their families—separations that often lead to children ending up in orphanages.**

We believe that the root of many social issues, including the creation of [orphans](../conversational-domain/orphan), lies in **poverty combined with illness, lack of access to proper education, family tensions, natural disasters, addiction, unemployment, divorce, and disability**. Therefore, one of the approaches we believe in is creating a **powerful dialogue space _[collaborative aid]_** where a fabric can be woven that embodies **love for all humanity—something that deeply defines what life is about for all of us**. By creating such a fabric, we can not only prevent the emergence of orphans in society and empower families to face challenges independently and resiliently but also create a future where people strive together for each other.

We make a bold promise to all of humanity: **we promise to create a space of conversational domain where not only will all orphanages be eliminated and all children live peacefully with their families ([foster parents](../conversational-domain/foster-parents)) but that space will become the natural expression of every individual worldwide.**

So far, we have worked to help over 15,000 children stay with their parents, navigating a very challenging path to achieve this. Our mission goes far beyond this—we are pursuing our values and goals with unwavering determination. I will also be sharing my articles and experiences here to inspire and support others on this journey.
