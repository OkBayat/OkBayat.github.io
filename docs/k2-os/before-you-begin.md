# Before You Begin
You probably didn’t fail because you didn’t try hard enough.
You read books.
You learned.
You experimented.

You had ideas.
You took courses.
You listened to different people.

And yet, a familiar discomfort stayed with you:

The feeling that you were trying seriously,
but not starting from the right place.

The problem was never a lack of information.
The problem was that with every new idea,
your focus shifted.

Every book suggested a new path.
Every recommendation introduced a new priority.
Every experience whispered, *“Maybe this instead.”*

Slowly, everything became important.
And when everything is important,
nothing truly moves forward.

You start many things.
You finish very few.

Decision-making becomes heavy.
Saying no feels impossible.

And the most painful part is not exhaustion.
It’s not lack of capability.

It’s **the sense of powerlessness**.

Not because you lack ability,
but because there is no system telling you
what deserves your focus *right now*.

At some point, a quiet thought appears:

> I wish I had found this earlier.
> Or I wish someone had addressed this before.
