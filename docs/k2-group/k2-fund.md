# K2-Fund
{ Enabling Students to Pursue Education Without Financial Barriers | fs-6 }

K2-Fund is a financial support initiative within K2, designed to help students who lack the financial resources to continue their education. Many talented students are forced to work instead of focusing on their studies. K2-Fund ensures that they can stay in university and complete their education without financial stress.  

We believe that education should not be a privilege for those who can afford it, but a fundamental right for those who have the determination and talent to succeed. Our goal is to remove financial obstacles and give students the opportunity to build a better future.  

K2-Fund does not operate as a traditional scholarship program. Instead of direct financial aid, we create sustainable support through investment. A set amount of money is allocated for each student and invested through K2. The monthly profit generated from these investments is given to the students to cover their living and educational expenses.  

This support is conditional. Students must remain enrolled and continue their studies. If they drop out, the financial support stops. This ensures that our resources are directed toward those who are committed to completing their education.  

Currently, we support 27 (Jan 2025) students, and we aim to expand this number as K2 grows. By identifying more students in need and increasing our financial resources, we can extend our support to a larger group.  

Beyond monthly financial assistance, K2-Fund also covers costs related to education, such as tuition fees, technical training, and essential study tools like laptops. This ensures that students are not only able to stay in school but are also equipped with the necessary skills and resources to succeed in their careers.  

Students who benefit from K2-Fund are encouraged to give back. After graduation, they have the option to either repay the support they received or contribute by helping another student. This creates a cycle of support, ensuring that K2-Fund can continue to help more students in the future.  

**K2-Fund is built on the belief that financial limitations should not dictate a student's future. By supporting talented individuals today, we are investing in the leaders, innovators, and changemakers of tomorrow.**
