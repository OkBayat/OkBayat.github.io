K2 is an innovative ecosystem for designing, developing, and executing strategic projects based on the **Shape-Up methodology**. This structure enables **dynamic participation, skill growth, and economic benefits** for its members. By leveraging the **Transformative Model**, K2 provides a platform for collaboration, talent development, and intelligent investment. Each project follows a **six-week cycle**, during which participants engage in a structured planning and investment process. For more details on the K2 model, visit the [K2 Transformative Model](../transformative-model).

## Project Credit Allocation

Each K2 project is assigned a **specific credit** amount, which serves as the **maximum investment cap for all participants**. This credit represents the significance and priority of the project. For instance, if a project has a **$50,000 credit**, the total investment by all participants in **K2-Crypto** cannot exceed this amount. This model ensures **transparency in financial resource allocation** and creates a **targeted and controlled investment pathway**.

## Participation and Investment in K2-Crypto

Participants in K2 projects can invest in **K2-Crypto** according to the project's allocated credit. This investment has two key characteristics:

- **Fixed Six-Week Period:** All investments in a project remain active throughout this six-week period.
- **Full Ownership of Profits:** All profits from the investment are directly allocated to the participants, with no portion taken by K2.

## Project Publication and Revenue Management

After **six weeks**, if a project is successfully completed, it enters the **publication and revenue generation phase**. At this stage, **a portion of the project's revenue** is automatically reinvested in **K2-Summit** for the participants. However, members have the option to **request direct withdrawal of their earnings** instead of reinvesting in K2-Summit.

## Selecting New Projects and Skill Development

Upon completion of a project, participants can select new projects and engage in the next development cycle. This process not only provides **expanded professional opportunities** but also fosters **continuous improvement of technical and managerial skills**.

## How to Join K2 Projects

All K2 projects are defined and managed within **Basecamp**. To join and participate in projects, the following steps must be followed:

- Interested individuals must **send an official request via email** and submit **their resume to k2@OkBayat.com**.
- Upon review and approval, individuals will be added to **Basecamp** and gain access to available projects.
- Each member can select a project based on **their abilities and expertise** and participate for **six weeks**.

## Team Formation and Member Collaboration

Each participant is responsible for forming **a specialized team** to execute their project. This team can be:

- Selected from existing K2 members.
- Composed of external professionals (in which case, new members must undergo a verification process).

If an external professional wishes to join a project, they must first **submit an official request via email to k2@OkBayat.com along with their resume**. Upon approval, they will be added to the designated project.

## Project Development Cycle and Publication

All K2 projects follow the **Shape-Up methodology**, emphasizing **precise scheduling, high-quality outputs, and intelligent prioritization of tasks**. At the end of each six-week cycle, the project is **officially released**, and its results are evaluated and analyzed.

## K2 as a Platform for Innovation, Growth, and Sustainable Investment

K2 is not just a project execution model but a comprehensive ecosystem for professional growth and skill development. Members can engage in **cutting-edge economic and technological projects**, benefiting from the revenue generated. This model enhances **individual and collective efficiency** while fostering **continuous innovation and the emergence of new ideas**.
