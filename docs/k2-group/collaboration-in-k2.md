# Collaboration in K2
{: .no_toc }
{ Comprehensive Guide to Collaboration in K2: A New Framework for Project Development and Investment | fs-6 }

K2 is more than just a project execution model; it is a comprehensive ecosystem for professional development. Members engage in cutting-edge economic and technological projects, benefiting from revenue generated through project sales, investments, and collaborative initiatives. This model enhances both individual and collective efficiency, fostering continuous innovation and the emergence of new ideas. For example, a recent K2 project in AI-driven market analysis led to the development of a predictive tool that helps investors identify market shifts in real time, showcasing how collaboration within K2 results in tangible, cutting-edge advancements.

K2 is an innovative ecosystem for designing, developing, and executing strategic projects based on the [Shape-Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) methodology. This structure fosters dynamic participation, skill growth, and economic benefits for its members. Through the **Transformative Model**, K2 offers a collaborative environment for talent development and intelligent investment. Each project follows a six-week cycle, where participants engage in a structured planning and investment process. For more details on the K2 model, visit the [K2 Transformative Model](./transformative-model).

## Project Credit Allocation

Each K2 project is assigned a specific credit amount, serving as the maximum investment cap for all participants. This credit represents the project's significance and priority. For example, if a project has a \$50,000 credit, the total investment by all participants in [K2-Crypto](./k2-cripto) cannot exceed this amount. This model ensures transparency in financial resource allocation and establishes a controlled investment pathway.

## Participation and Investment in K2-Crypto

Only K2 members can invest in [K2-Crypto](./k2-cripto) according to the allocated project credit for each project. This investment is characterized by two key aspects:

- **Fixed Investment Period:** Investments in a project remain active throughout its duration.
- **Full Ownership of Profits:** All investment profits are allocated directly to K2 members, with no share taken by K2.

## Project Completion and Revenue Management

After six weeks, if a project is successfully completed, it transitions into the publication and revenue generation phase. At this stage, a portion of the project's revenue is automatically reinvested in [K2-Summit](./k2-summit) for participants. However, members may opt to withdraw their earnings instead of reinvesting in [K2-Summit](./k2-summit).

## Selecting New Projects and Skill Development

Upon project completion, participants can choose new projects and engage in the next development cycle. This process provides professional growth opportunities and facilitates continuous improvement in technical and managerial skills.

## How to Join K2

To join and participate in K2 projects, follow these steps:

1. Submit an official request via email and attach your resume to **[k2@OkBayat.com](mailto:k2@OkBayat.com)**.
2. Upon review and approval, you will receive further details on available projects.
3. Each member can request to join any project based on their expertise and participate for the projectâ€™s duration.

## Team Formation and Collaboration

Each participant is responsible for assembling a specialized team to execute their project. This team may be:

- Selected from existing K2 members.
- Composed of external professionals (who must undergo an approval process before joining).

External professionals interested in joining a project must submit a request and resume via email to **[k2@OkBayat.com](mailto:k2@OkBayat.com)**. Upon approval, they will be added to the designated project.

## Project Development Cycle and Release

All K2 projects follow the [Shape-Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) methodology, emphasizing structured planning, high-quality outputs, and intelligent task prioritization. At the end of each project cycle, the project is officially released, with results evaluated and analyzed. However, in some cases, projects may extend beyond the standard cycle if additional development or refinement is required.

Members engage in cutting-edge economic and technological projects, benefiting from generated revenue. This model enhances both individual and collective efficiency, fostering continuous innovation and the emergence of new ideas.
