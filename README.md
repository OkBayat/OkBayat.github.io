# okbayat.com — Content Architecture & Editorial Guide

This document is the reference guide (README) for the content structure, navigation, and editorial direction of **okbayat.com**.

Its purpose is to ensure that, even if context or memory is lost in the future, it is always clear:

* What kind of content is produced
* Where each piece of content belongs
* Why this structure was chosen

---

## 1. Site Mission

okbayat.com is a **thinking‑driven personal website** — not a news blog, not a sales landing page, and not a simple résumé.

The mission of the site is:

* Deep thinking about **entrepreneurship, startups, building systems, decision‑making, and leadership**
* Capturing and publishing ideas with long‑term value (Evergreen Content)
* Building a personal intellectual archive, similar in spirit to essay‑based websites

This site is meant to be a **home for thinking**, not a **content factory for algorithms**.

---

## 2. Content Principles (Non‑Negotiables)

These principles must always be respected:

1. **Ideas over format**

   * Articles, podcasts, and translations are tools; ideas are the core.

2. **Quality over quantity**

   * Publish less, but publish work that lasts.

3. **Thinking, not shallow education**

   * Pure how‑tos, generic checklists, and motivational filler are explicitly excluded.

4. **The site must remain uncluttered**

   * Minimal navigation, clear categorization.

---

## 3. Canonical Navigation Structure

The main navigation of the site must include only the following sections:

1. Essays
2. Translations
3. Podcast
4. Projects
5. Leadership & Personal Development
6. About

No additional top‑level items should be added without revisiting the entire architecture.

## 4. Precise Definition of Each Section

### 4.1 Essays

**The core of the site**

Definition:

* Original analytical writing authored by the site owner
* Long‑form, idea‑driven essays

Topics include:

* Entrepreneurship
* Startups
* Founder Mode and management
* Decision‑making
* Building systems and leverage
* Personal experiences that can be generalized

Guidelines:

* Every essay should still be worth reading five years from now

---

### 4.2 Translations

**Curated translations with high intellectual value**

Definition:

* Translations of carefully selected texts from thinkers and writers in startups, technology, and thinking

Rules:

* Every translation must include a short introduction explaining why the text matters
* Blind or neutral translation without intent or editorial judgment is not allowed

Typical content:

* Startup‑related essays
* Long‑form, idea‑centric writing

---

### 4.3 Podcast

**The voice of the written thinking**

Definition:

* A complement to the written work, not a replacement for it

Preferred format:

* Solo episodes
* Deep analysis of a single idea or experience

Key rule:

* Every episode should either originate from an essay or lead back to one

---

**Proof of execution, not claims**

Definition:

* Real projects, startups, and systems that have been actively worked on

Includes:

* Startups
* Products
* Systems

Note:

* Failures are as important as successes and should be documented

---

### 4.5 Leadership & Personal Development

**A supporting domain, not the center of gravity**

Definition:

* Content related to leadership, coaching, personal development, and mental models

Includes:

* Leadership Resources
* Coaching
* Programs

Rule:

* This section must never overshadow the core identity of the site

---

### 4.6 About

**Identity, not a dry résumé**

Includes:

* Personal introduction
* Intellectual and professional trajectory
* Why this site exists
* Résumé (linked, not central)

---

## 5. Mapping Existing Content to the New Structure

* Current Blog → Essays
* Leadership Resources → Leadership & Personal Development
* Leadership Programs → Leadership & Personal Development
* Coaching → Leadership & Personal Development
* Existing Podcast → Podcast
* K2 Group → Projects
* Resume → About
* Calendar → About (or removed if unused)

---

## 6. Editorial Direction & Content Mix

Recommended production ratio:

* 60% Essays
* 20% Translations
* 20% Podcast

Writing is always the primary medium.

---

## 7. Deliberately Excluded Sections

The following are intentionally not part of the structure:

* Blog (in the disposable, content‑marketing sense)
* Generic Resources
* News
* Courses / Products (for now)

If any of these are added in the future, this document must be revised.

---

## 8. Success Criteria

The success of okbayat.com is measured by:

* Readers returning voluntarily
* Intellectual references, not likes or views
* Longevity of content
* Clarity of intellectual identity

---

## 9. Final Note

Whenever you hesitate and ask:

“Should this be published?”

Return to this question:

> Does this writing / voice / idea clarify something — or is it just content production?

If the answer is not clear, do not publish it.
