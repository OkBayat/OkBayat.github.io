## How this document is maintained
This document is inspired by Gitlab Handbook and is the result of iterative changes. Our goal is to write everything a person needs to get onboard and contribute in K2 Group. The policy is that everyone facing a new issue or question that is not yet written in the handbook must write a related page in this handbook to make it closer and closer to complete.
Enjoy :)
